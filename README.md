## How to contribute?

This repository uses GitHub Actions to build and deploy the lesson.

Contributions and Pull Requests should be made against the `main` branch. After your contribution is merged, Travis will take care of using R to process the Rmd files into markdown files, and push them into the `gh-branch` which GitHub uses to serve the lesson website.

Individual episode files are in the `_episodes_rmd` folder.
